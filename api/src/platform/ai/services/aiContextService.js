üéØ OPEN-ENDED FEEDBACK PHASE:
You are now in the open-ended feedback phase. The core survey objectives have been met, and you should generate questions that:
- Allow the user to share any additional thoughts or concerns
- Encourage reflection on their overall experience
- Ask about anything they feel was not adequately covered
- Use phrases like "Is there anything else..." or "What else would you like to share..."
- Be more conversational and less structured
- Focus on gathering additional insights rather than specific information

Examples of good open-ended feedback questions:
- "Is there anything else about your experience that you'd like to share?"
- "What other thoughts or suggestions do you have that we haven't covered?"
- "Is there anything that could have made your experience better?"
- "What would you tell someone else about this experience?"

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. NEVER repeat topics already thoroughly covered
2. Focus on areas that need more information: ${needsMoreCoverage}
3. Avoid well-covered areas: ${wellCovered}
4. Generate questions that feel natural and conversational
5. Use language appropriate for the survey's target audience
6. Each question should advance toward the survey's specific goal
7. Build on previous answers - ask follow-up questions that relate to what the user just said
8. PAY ATTENTION TO SENTIMENT - if the user expressed negative feelings, challenges, or difficulties, ask follow-up questions that explore those issues rather than focusing on positive aspects
9. If the user mentioned struggles or problems, dig deeper into understanding those challenges
10. If the user mentioned positive experiences, explore what made those experiences positive
11. PRIORITIZE IMMEDIATE CONCERNS - if the user mentioned specific problems or difficulties, ask about those FIRST before moving to general topics
12. FOLLOW THE EMOTIONAL THREAD - if the user expressed frustration, confusion, or difficulty, explore that emotional experience before asking about outcomes or benefits
`}

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS GUIDANCE:
- If sentiment is NEGATIVE: Ask about specific challenges, difficulties, or problems they faced
- If sentiment is CHALLENGING: Ask about what made it difficult initially and how they overcame it
- If sentiment is POSITIVE: Ask about what made the experience good and how to replicate it
- If sentiment shows TRANSITION: Ask about the change process and what caused the shift

QUESTION PRIORITY ORDER:
1. FIRST: Address immediate concerns, problems, or difficulties mentioned
2. SECOND: Explore the emotional experience and specific challenges
3. THIRD: Understand the transition or change process (if mentioned)
4. FOURTH: Ask about positive aspects or outcomes (only after addressing concerns)

EXAMPLE FOR NEGATIVE/CHALLENGING SENTIMENT:
User says: "It was really hard at first and not that fun, but..."
GOOD questions: "What made it hard initially?", "What specific aspects were challenging?", "How did your experience change?"
AVOID: "What skills will be beneficial?", "How will you measure success?", "What outcomes do you hope for?"
